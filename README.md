 Java serves as a common programming language for newcomers. Think of it as our way of chatting with computers. Software engineers wield Java to craft an array of appsâ€”web, mobile, and desktop ones. These apps  fall under the Java applications or programs category because they are constructed with Java. 

 You have most likely bumped into programs demanding the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for operation. This component enables your computer to run Java programs. For crafting and compiling Java programs, you    will need the Java Development Kit (JDK), bundled with the JRE and handy compilers and tools. With JDK installation, the JRE comes along automatically.
