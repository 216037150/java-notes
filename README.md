 Java serves as a common programming language for newcomers. Think of it as our way of chatting with computers. Software engineers wield Java to craft an array of appsâ€”web, mobile, and desktop ones. These apps  fall under the Java applications or programs category because they are constructed with Java. 

 You have most likely bumped into programs demanding the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for operation. This component enables your computer to run Java programs. For crafting and compiling Java programs, you    will need the Java Development Kit (JDK), bundled with the JRE and handy compilers and tools. With JDK installation, the JRE comes along automatically.


# JDK
The 'SE' stands for the standard edition, which suits our needs perfectly. We are currently working with Java 17.0.2, the latest version in development. But no need to stress, if there are newer versions when you are in the course, feel free to use those. Just remember, as you delve deeper into Java, the differences between versions matter more. Also, ensure you grab the right JDK for your operating system.

# Installing IntelliJ IDEA
 In this course, We will be using IntelliJ, a free and open-source code editor. You can grab it from jetbrains.com/idea, just hit that download button. They will try to detect your operating system for you,     so just make sure they have got it right. Look for the Community Edition download and start the download. Once it is finished, simply double-click to open it.
