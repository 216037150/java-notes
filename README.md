 Java serves as a common programming language for newcomers. Think of it as our way of chatting with computers. Software engineers wield Java to craft an array of apps—web, mobile, and desktop ones. These apps  fall under the Java applications or programs category because they are constructed with Java. 

 You have most likely bumped into programs demanding the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for operation. This component enables your computer to run Java programs. For crafting and compiling Java programs, you    will need the Java Development Kit (JDK), bundled with the JRE and handy compilers and tools. With JDK installation, the JRE comes along automatically.


# JDK
The 'SE' stands for the standard edition, which suits our needs perfectly. We are currently working with Java 17.0.2, the latest version in development. But no need to stress, if there are newer versions when you are in the course, feel free to use those. Just remember, as you delve deeper into Java, the differences between versions matter more. Also, ensure you grab the right JDK for your operating system.

# Installing IntelliJ IDEA
 In this course, We will be using IntelliJ, a free and open-source code editor. You can grab it from jetbrains.com/idea, just hit that download button. They will try to detect your operating system for you,     so just make sure they have got it right. Look for the Community Edition download and start the download. Once it is finished, simply double-click to open it.

 If you are using a Mac, drag the application into your Applications folder. On Windows, follow the installation prompts. Once that is all sorted out, double-click on the app. This is where We will be doing      all our coding—it is our IDE, short for integrated development environment. So, moving forward, all our code will be written here. Easy as pie!

 There are a couple of ways to write and run Java programs. One option involves using a text editor and the command line. Essentially, you type out the code in a text editor like Sublime or Atom, and then you   rely on the command line to both compile and execute it. For instance, you could write some code in the text editor to display "Hello" in the console, and then you would execute it through the command line

 To get started, you will want to click on "New Project" and configure some settings. One of the key things to configure is the specific version of Java We will use for coding and running our programs. Do you   happen to know which Java version we should opt for?

After we download Java 20, let's go ahead and choose that option. If Java 20 is not showing up, just make sure you have downloaded the JDK for Java 20. 

Moving on, we will give our project the name "Learning Java" and make a new folder for it on our desktop. Once those steps are done, we are all set to start our project by hitting the "Create" button.
